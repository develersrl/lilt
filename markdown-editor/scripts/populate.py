            #    the user, lowering the chance he'll stumble into one of these
            #    dirs and manually change stuff.
            # 2: We need to generate the name in a referentially-transparent
            #    way; that is, given the same input, we get the same output.
            #    An uuid is not the right choice here like it is for file
            #    names inside the page directories, because in that case given
            #    the same file name (perhaps from different directories) we

            #    the generated name contains characters that can be used by
            #    every filesystem, even case-insensitive ones. Base32 can do

            # filesystems we want the generated name for "foo" and "FOO" to be
